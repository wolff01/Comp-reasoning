The reason for hitting is that a 7 is considered a weak hand that has a very low chance of winning, and the dealer has a potentially weaker hand showing. The dealer's 6 is a bust card, meaning they are likely to bust if they follow the rules to hit until reaching 17 or higher. Therefore, hitting in this situation gives you the best chance of improving your hand to beat the dealer.
