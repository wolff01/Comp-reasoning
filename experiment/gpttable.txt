The dealer is showing a 10, suggesting a potentially strong hand. Given your current total, you are in a position where you should try to improve your hand, as 12 is not likely to win against a potentially strong dealer hand. The decision to hit is made to try to increase your total closer to 21. Insuring your hand is generally not recommended, especially with a relatively weak hand like 12, because the insurance bet is considered a side bet with a negative expected value.

The dealer is showing a 10, which is a strong card and poses a high likelihood of having a total closer to 20. In this situation, hitting is a reasonable choice because your hand total of 12 is not strong enough to confidently stand against the dealer. Therefore, hitting gives you a chance to improve your hand and potentially get closer to 21 without busting.

It essentially creates a side bet with unfavorable odds. In this scenario, even though the dealer is showing a 10, you have a total of 12 (2 and King), which is not a strong hand but still has potential if you hit. The odds of the dealer having a blackjack and the insurance bet being profitable are not high enough to justify the cost.
chatcmpl-Agy4PJ5qXVn2JmRQ6XBoVY1H7e8eu gpt-4o-2024-08-06    2024-12-21      no insurance    In blackjack, taking insurance is generally considered a bad bet for the player. The dealer offering insurance usually means they have a face-up 10, and the insurance bet pays 2:1. However, there are only 4 aces in a 52-card deck, so the probability of the dealer having a blackjack (i.e., a total of 21) is low. In the long run, the odds are not favorable for taking insurance. Since I currently have a total of 12 with my 2 and King, it would be better to play the hand as usual without taking insurance.
chatcmpl-AgydNGMn8lMZZ4PIk2i2AVO9h6BmW gpt-4o-2024-08-06    2024-12-21      do not insure   In blackjack, insurance is basically a side bet on whether the dealer has a blackjack when showing a 10-value card. The odds of the dealer having a blackjack in this scenario are roughly 4 out of 13, or about 30.8%. The payout for insurance is typically 2 to 1, but because the actual probability of the dealer having a blackjack is lower than the payoff odds, insurance is generally considered a bad bet. Additionally, you already have a strong hand with a total value of 12. It is better not to take the insurance and hope the dealer does not have an ace.

I should hit to draw another card and attempt to increase my total hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it. Additionally, choosing to insure my hand would not be a wise decision in this scenario because my hand value is quite low, and opting for insurance would only protect against the dealer having a natural blackjack, which doesn't improve my weak hand regardless of the outcome.

The odds are in favor of increasing your total without busting. Taking insurance is not advisable here since insurance is generally not a good bet mathematically, as it assumes the probability of the dealer having a blackjack is high, which is not the case.

Therefore, it is advisable to hit to try to improve the hand value closer to 21. Additionally, since the dealer is showing a 10 and is likely to have a strong hand, it's important to strengthen my hand. Insurance is not a good option here since the insurance bet has a negative expected value over time, and my main focus should be on improving my own hand.
