Taking insurance is generally not recommended if you're not counting cards, as it is not statistically advantageous in the long run. The chances of the dealer having a blackjack (a hidden Ace to pair with their 10) is approximately 30%. Given these odds, the insurance bet \u2014 which pays 2:1 \u2014 is not favorable. It's best to avoid spending extra on insurance and focus on your own hand's potential to improve or force the dealer to bust.\"\n}\n```",

        "reasoning": "You have a total of 12 (2 + King), which is a weak hand against the dealer's 10 showing. You should hit to try to improve your hand because the probability of reaching a stronger hand like a 17 or higher by hitting is better than standing on a total of 12. Insurance is not advisable here because, without a specific bet amount, assuming standard strategy over the long run, taking insurance is generally considered a bad bet unless you have precise knowledge of the count of cards remaining in the deck."
