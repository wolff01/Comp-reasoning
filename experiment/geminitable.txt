Hitting gives me the best chance to improve my hand without risking a bust myself. Since the dealer's up card is a 6 (a weak card), basic strategy suggests hitting on a total of 7 to aim for a higher total. It is not advisable to double down here. While 7 is not ideal and normally warrants a hit, it is particularly weak against a 6, so doubling down increases risk without as much reward.

Even if I draw a face card or a 10, I will have 21. Any other card gives me a reasonable total to continue playing.

The dealer is showing a 10, meaning they could have a strong hand.  Hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand without risking more money by doubling down.  Since the dealer has a ten it is not possible to split.

Since the dealer has a 3, they are likely to have to take more cards, increasing their risk of busting.  Even if they don't bust, I have a good chance of improving my hand with a hit.

Splitting 7s against a dealer's 3 through 7 is a basic strategy play.  This gives me a better chance of winning two hands with a total of 7, compared to playing a 14 which is a weak hand.

The dealer is likely to bust with a 5 showing, and doubling down maximizes the potential return in this favorable situation.

You have a hard 13, and the dealer is showing a 6.  A 6 is a weak dealer upcard, making it likely they will bust.  Doubling down allows you to maximize your potential winnings when the dealer is likely to bust.

The risk of busting by taking a hit (and losing the entire bet) is much greater than the chance of the dealer getting a better hand.  Insurance is not a good bet in general and certainly not worthwhile here. Standing gives the best chance of winning.

Since the dealer has a 9, they are likely to have a final score of 17, 18, or 19.  Hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand and get closer to 21 without busting.  Standing with 15 is very risky against a dealer's 9.

The dealer showing a 10 suggests they could have a strong hand as well, but hitting risks busting. Standing gives me a high probability of winning if the dealer busts or has a lower total.

Standing gives me the best chance of winning.  Hitting risks busting, and splitting or doubling down would be suboptimal with such a high total.

A 6 is a weak dealer upcard, and you have a good chance of improving your hand with one more card without busting. Doubling down allows you to maximize your potential winnings in this favorable situation.

chatcmpl-2a5fcc3f-acfe-41f8-9f52-97561c77334f gemini-1.5-pro       2025-01-29      hit             I have a hand total of 15 (2 + 6 + 7).  This is a weak hand against the dealer's Queen.  Hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand without risking a bust (going over 21).  Standing on 15 is very risky against a dealer who could have 17 or higher. Doubling down or splitting is not an option at this point as the player already has taken a hit.
chatcmpl-52eac408-574e-4464-88d2-c05c47a52174 gemini-1.5-pro       2025-01-29      hit             My hand totals 12 (2 + 6 + 5, the 7 has been played).  This is a weak hand and I need more cards to get closer to 21 without busting. Since the dealer has a Queen (10), they are likely to have a strong hand. Hitting is the best option to improve my chances of winning.

Since the dealer is showing a 3, the risk of busting by hitting is far greater than the chance of the dealer drawing cards to beat 20. Standing is the optimal play.

Since the dealer is showing a low card (a 2), they are more likely to bust themselves trying to reach 17.  Standing gives me the best chance of winning if the dealer busts.
chatcmpl-9d9b282a-dfe4-45f8-a851-16cf8824bfbb gemini-1.5-pro       2025-01-30      stand           I have 20, which is a very strong hand. The dealer is showing a 6, which is a weak card.  The dealer must hit until they reach 17 or bust.  They are likely to bust trying to reach 17, so standing gives me the best chance of winning.
chatcmpl-3fcbdf06-4e31-42af-b26f-4d2b9db112fc gemini-1.5-pro       2025-01-30      double down     A starting hand of 12 against a dealer's upcard of 5 is a favorable situation for the player. Doubling down allows you to maximize your potential winnings by doubling your bet.  A 10, Jack, Queen, or King gives you 22 which would result in a bust, however any card less than 10 will give you a hand between 13 and 21.  A dealer showing a 5 is likely to have to hit to improve their hand, increasing their chances of busting, especially if they draw a high card. While there's always a chance of busting yourself by doubling down, the potential reward in this situation outweighs the risk.

Since the dealer is showing a Queen (value 10), there's a reasonable chance they have a 17 (10 + 7) or higher. Hitting risks busting, and splitting isn't an option with different values. Standing gives me the best chance of winning or pushing.

The dealer has a 9, which means they are likely to have a hand of 17, 18, or 19.  Hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand and get closer to 21 without busting. While there's a risk of busting, it's a greater risk to stand with such a low hand against a dealer's 9.

Splitting them gives me two hands starting with a 10-value card, each of which has a good chance of getting to 18-21 with one hit. This is a better strategy than hitting or standing on 10 against a dealer's 9.

The risk of busting by taking another card is much greater than the chance of the dealer getting a better hand. Standing is the optimal play.

The dealer showing a Queen doesn't influence my decision at this low total. I am far away from 21 therefore I must hit.
chatcmpl-0aba70e9-2071-40c7-aa71-3caead0e2dee gemini-1.5-pro       2025-01-31      hit             I have a hand totaling 17 (2 + 5 + 10). The dealer is showing a Queen (10).  While 17 is a decent hand, the dealer is likely to have a strong hand as well.  Hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand and potentially beat the dealer without risking going bust by exceeding 21. It's a close call between hitting and standing, but with a 17 against a dealer's 10, hitting offers a slightly better chance of winning.
