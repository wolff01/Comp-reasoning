It's highly probable the dealer has a strong hand.  Hitting is the best option to improve my hand value and get closer to 21 without busting. Error

Hitting risks busting, and since the dealer shows a 10-value card, they are likely to have a strong hand as well.  Standing gives me the best chance of winning. Error     
chatcmpl-3dea4fc5-badb-44a8-8c6d-8e26a2c2a95b gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      stand           You have 20, a very strong hand.  The dealer is showing a 6, a weak card.  Standing gives you the highest probability of winning. Error

Since the dealer is showing a 5, they are likely to bust if they hit to try and beat your hand. Standing is the optimal play to maximize your chances of winning. Error     
chatcmpl-047beb4a-487d-4b52-9383-48d225a45de8 gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      split           With a pair of 3s against a dealer 6, splitting is the optimal play.  The dealer is likely to bust with a 6 showing, and splitting gives us two chances to improve our hand and beat the dealer.  If we don't split, hitting is also reasonable because our hand total is low. Error     
chatcmpl-efa6e6ab-8f8a-485a-8acd-281369e0d05e gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      double down     With a hand totaling 10 against a dealer's 6, the player has a high probability of winning by doubling down.  The dealer is likely to bust with a 6 showing, and the player's hand is in a strong position to improve with one additional card. Error     
chatcmpl-e14e4a02-a066-402b-8824-c6dd0a42f550 gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      hit             The player's hand totals 7.  With a dealer upcard of 6, the dealer is likely to bust (go over 21). The player should hit to improve their hand without much risk of busting themselves. Error

While 17 is a decent hand, the dealer showing a 6 is likely to bust.  Hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand without much risk of busting myself. Standing on 17 risks the dealer drawing cards to 17 or more. Error     
chatcmpl-6f07d1da-d6a1-473d-8f2d-1358cbf8a48e gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      double down     You have a total of 16 against the dealer's 9.  A 16 is a very weak hand, but a 9 is a bad card for the dealer.  Doubling down gives you a chance to improve your hand significantly with one extra card while maximizing your potential winnings if you do improve.  Hitting is an option, but doubling down is the more aggressive and higher expected value play in this scenario. Error

We have a high probability of improving our hand with one more card without busting, and the dealer's 2 is a weak upcard. Error

The dealer is showing a low card and has to hit until they reach at least 17.  The risk of busting by taking another card is higher than the potential reward of improving my hand. Error     
chatcmpl-f4ce15bc-cfb2-497a-9746-aebf759c4025 gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      double down     With a soft 15 against a dealer's 3, doubling down is the optimal play.  There's a good chance of getting a card that improves the hand to 16-21, and even if we bust, the dealer still has to beat our total.  The dealer showing a 3 is a weak card, increasing the likelihood they will bust trying to reach 17 or higher. Error     
chatcmpl-5189173b-d9ec-4256-9fae-8b85c1d6073b gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      stand           You have 15.  The dealer is showing a 10-value card (Jack).  While the dealer could have a 17 or less and bust, they could also have a high hand (17-21). The risk of busting by taking a hit is too high with a 15, so the best play is to stand and hope the dealer busts. Error

The dealer showing a 5 is favorable for the player, but you need more cards to improve your hand.  Hitting is the best option to get closer to 21 without exceeding it. Error     
chatcmpl-6dce33c4-d771-470a-80d1-98f0ec37e684 gemini-1.5-pro       2025-02-04      hit             My hand totals 10.  I have a reasonable chance of improving my hand with a hit. While I could stand, hitting gives me a chance to get closer to 21 without busting. The dealer's upcard is a 5, which is a weak card, making it more likely they will bust. Thus, hitting is the best option to improve my chances of winning. Error

I need to hit to improve my hand and get closer to 21 without busting. Since I'm far from 21 (and can't bust with another card) and the dealer has a low card showing, it makes sense to hit.

Hitting risks busting, and while 18 isn't the best possible hand, it's likely to win against the dealer's upcard.  Since I have more than two cards, the only options are to hit or stand. Error

There's a high risk of busting by hitting, and the dealer has a reasonable chance of busting or ending up with a lower total. Error

Two hands starting with a 9 have a good chance of beating the dealer's 10, especially if the dealer's hole card is weak.  While doubling is tempting, splitting offers higher expected value in the long run. Error

The dealer must hit on 16 and lower, so there's a reasonable chance they will bust. Standing gives you the best chance of winning given the circumstances. Error

There's a high risk of busting by hitting, and 17 has a reasonable chance of winning against the dealer's potential totals. Error

With a dealer showing a Queen (10), it's highly likely they have a strong hand.  Hitting is the best option to improve my hand's value and get closer to 21 without busting. Error

The dealer is showing a 10-value card (Queen), so there's a reasonable chance they have a strong hand.  Hitting risks busting (going over 21), so standing is the safest play with a 16 against a dealer's 10. Error

A 7 is a dangerous dealer upcard, and 12 is a weak hand that must be improved. Hitting gives me a chance to get closer to 21 without busting. Error
