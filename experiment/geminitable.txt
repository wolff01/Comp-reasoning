Hitting gives me the best chance to improve my hand without risking a bust myself. Since the dealer's up card is a 6 (a weak card), basic strategy suggests hitting on a total of 7 to aim for a higher total. It is not advisable to double down here. While 7 is not ideal and normally warrants a hit, it is particularly weak against a 6, so doubling down increases risk without as much reward.
