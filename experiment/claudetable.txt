The dealer's 6 is a weak upcard, but our hand is too weak to stand. We want to improve our hand to at least 12 or higher to have a better chance of winning. Hitting gives us the opportunity to potentially get a better hand without risking busting, as any card from 2 to 10 would improve our position. Doubling down would be too risky with such a low total, and we can't split non-matching cards. Insurance is not offered since the dealer isn't showing an Ace or 10.
