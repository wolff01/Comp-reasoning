The dealer's 6 is a weak upcard, but our hand is too weak to stand. We want to improve our hand to at least 12 or higher to have a better chance of winning. Hitting gives us the opportunity to potentially get a better hand without risking busting, as any card from 2 to 10 would improve our position. Doubling down would be too risky with such a low total, and we can't split non-matching cards. Insurance is not offered since the dealer isn't showing an Ace or 10.

An 11 is a strong starting hand, as any 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, King) will give you a strong total of 21. Even if you don't get a 10-value card, you still have a good chance of improving your hand with a high card. The dealer is showing a 10, which means they have a strong possibility of having 20 if their hole card is a 10-value card. By doubling down, you're increasing your potential winnings on a hand where you have a good chance of beating the dealer. This is a standard play in blackjack strategy when you have 11 and the dealer has a 10 or lower.

The dealer's upcard of 3 is relatively weak, suggesting they may need to hit multiple times to reach a competitive total. By hitting, I have a chance to get a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) which would give me a strong hand of 21. Even if I receive a lower card, I'll still have the option to hit again or stand, depending on the new total. This strategy maximizes my potential to beat the dealer's hand while minimizing the risk of busting.

However, in this specific scenario, we already have three cards, which means we've already hit once. According to the rules provided, when we have more than 3 cards, we can only choose to hit or stand. Given that our total is 18, which is a strong hand, the best choice is to stand. Standing gives us a good chance of winning unless the dealer manages to get 19 or higher without busting. Hitting would risk busting our hand, which is already close to 21.

This is because there's a good chance of improving the hand significantly with one more card. Many cards (10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5) will result in a strong hand of 17 or better. Even if a 6, 7, 8, or 9 is drawn, the resulting hand will still be competitive. Additionally, the dealer's upcard of 5 is considered weak, increasing the likelihood of the dealer busting. By doubling down, we're taking advantage of a favorable situation to potentially double our winnings.

The dealer is showing a strong card (10), which means they have a high chance of having a good hand. In this situation, standing would likely result in a loss if the dealer has any card 7 or higher as their hole card. While hitting carries the risk of busting, it's the better option here. My goal is to improve my hand, hopefully drawing a low card (2-5) to give me a better chance of winning or at least pushing against the dealer's hand. Insurance is not a good option here as it's generally considered a poor bet in the long run, and I don't have a strong enough hand to consider splitting or doubling down.

The dealer's 6 is a weak upcard, meaning they have a high chance of busting. However, our 13 is also a weak hand that's likely to lose if we stand. By hitting, we have a good chance of improving our hand without risking much, as any card 8 or lower will keep us in the game. Even if we bust, the dealer has a high probability of busting as well when starting with a 6. This decision aligns with basic blackjack strategy, which recommends hitting on 13 when the dealer shows a 6.

The dealer is showing a strong card (Queen, which is worth 10), so I need to try to get a stronger hand to compete. Hitting gives me the chance to draw a 10-value card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) for a strong total of 21, or any card 9 or lower to still have a chance to beat the dealer. Standing on 11 would likely result in a loss against the dealer's strong upcard, and splitting or doubling down are not optimal plays with this hand composition.

This is a strong hand in blackjack, especially against a dealer showing a 3. The dealer's 3 is a weak upcard, meaning they have a higher chance of busting when they draw to complete their hand. Standing on 17 is generally the best strategy in this situation, as hitting would risk busting my own hand. Additionally, the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17, so there's a good chance they'll either bust or end up with a hand of 17-21, giving me a fair opportunity to win or push.

The dealer is showing a 9, which means they have a strong chance of having a high hand. In this situation, hitting is the best option because standing on 15 is likely to lose against the dealer's hand. By hitting, I have a chance to improve my hand without risking an immediate bust, as any card 6 or lower will keep me in the game. Even if I draw a 10-value card and bust, the likelihood of winning with a 15 against a dealer's 9 is low anyway. The goal is to try to get closer to 21 without going over, and hitting gives me the best opportunity to do so in this scenario.

The dealer is showing a weak upcard of 5, which means they have a high probability of busting. Doubling down in this situation allows us to increase our bet when we have a favorable advantage. By doubling down, we'll receive one more card to potentially improve our hand, while maximizing our potential winnings against the dealer's weak position. This is a classic scenario where doubling down is the optimal strategy in blackjack.

The dealer is showing a 10, which means they have a high chance of having a strong hand (20 if they have a face card or 10 underneath). However, the dealer also has a significant chance of busting if they have to hit on a lower card. Standing on 18 is generally considered the best play in this situation, as hitting would risk busting our strong hand, while standing gives us a good chance of winning if the dealer busts or ends up with a lower total.

It's very close to 21, and the probability of improving this hand is extremely low. Any additional card would likely cause me to bust (go over 21). The dealer is showing an 8, which means they need to draw at least one more card and have a high chance of busting or ending up with a lower total than my 20. Standing on 20 gives me a very strong position to win this hand.

This is a relatively weak hand, and the dealer is showing a 6, which is considered a weak upcard for the dealer. The basic strategy for blackjack suggests that when holding a soft 15 against a dealer's 6, the best play is to hit. This gives me the opportunity to improve my hand without the risk of busting, as the Ace can be counted as 1 if needed. Additionally, hitting on this hand gives me a better chance of beating the dealer if they end up with a strong hand after hitting on their 16.

The optimal play is to count the Ace as 1, giving me a total of 13. The dealer is showing a 6, which is a weak upcard. There's a good chance the dealer will bust when they hit on their 16 or less. Standing on 13 against a dealer's 6 is the correct strategic play in this situation, as it gives me the best chance to win the hand without risking going over 21 myself.

The dealer is showing a Queen, which has a value of 10, putting them in a strong position. In this situation, hitting is the best option as I need to improve my hand to have any chance of winning. Standing on 8 would almost certainly result in a loss, and splitting or doubling down are not valid options with these cards. By hitting, I have a good chance of improving my hand without the risk of busting, as any card from 2 to 10 or an Ace would be beneficial.

The dealer is showing a Queen, which has a value of 10. There's a high probability that the dealer's hidden card is a low value card, giving them a total between 14 and 20. If we hit, there's a significant risk of busting (going over 21) since any card 7 or higher would cause us to lose. By standing, we have a chance to win if the dealer busts or ends up with a lower total. While 15 isn't a strong hand, it's safer to stand in this situation and hope the dealer busts.

The dealer is showing a 3, which is a relatively weak card. The probability of the dealer beating a 20 is low, as they would need to draw multiple cards without busting. Standing on 20 is the optimal play in this situation, as it maximizes the chances of winning the hand while minimizing risk.

The dealer is showing a 2, which is a relatively weak upcard. In this situation, the best strategy is to hit. There's a good chance of improving my hand without busting, as any card 7 or lower will help. Even if I draw a 10-value card and bust, I'm not giving up much, as my chances of winning with 14 against a dealer's 2 are low if I stand. The goal is to try to get closer to 21 without going over, increasing my chances of beating the dealer's final hand.

This gives you two strong hands to play against the dealer's weak upcard of 6. The dealer has a high probability of busting with a 6 showing, and by splitting, you maximize your chances of winning on both hands. Each new hand will start with a strong 10, giving you a great position to either stand or double down depending on the next card dealt. This strategy increases your overall expected value in this situation.

This is a weak hand that is likely to lose against the dealer's 6 upcard. The dealer's 6 is a weak upcard, and they are likely to bust if they draw a 10-value card (which is common). However, my 14 is still too weak to stand on. The best strategic play is to hit, hoping to improve my hand without busting. If I draw a 7 or lower, I'll have a better chance of winning. Even if I draw an 8 or higher and bust, I was likely to lose anyway if I had stood on 14. Hitting gives me the best chance to win or at least push against the dealer's hand.

The dealer has a high probability of busting with a 6 up-card, as they must hit on 16 or below. By standing, we avoid the risk of busting ourselves and give the dealer a chance to bust. Additionally, since we already have three cards, our options are limited to hit or stand, and hitting on 16 against a dealer's 6 would be too risky.

The dealer has a weak upcard (6), which means they have a high probability of busting. However, your hand of 13 is still weak and at risk of busting if you stand. By hitting, you have a chance to improve your hand without a high risk of busting, as any card 8 or lower (which is more than half the deck) will keep you in the game. This gives you a better opportunity to beat the dealer, especially if they end up busting with their weak upcard.

The dealer is showing a 5, which is a relatively weak upcard. In this situation, it's generally better to hit because the risk of busting (going over 21) is outweighed by the potential to improve the hand. There's a good chance of drawing a card that will improve the hand without busting, such as any card from 2 to 9. Even if the next card is a 10-value card, resulting in a 22 and a bust, this is still statistically a better play than standing on 12 against a dealer's 5, as the dealer has a good chance of making a hand between 17 and 21.

The dealer is showing a 5, which is a weak upcard. There's a good chance the dealer will bust when drawing to complete their hand. Additionally, hitting on 16 is risky as there's a high probability of busting (any card 6 or higher would cause a bust). Standing gives us the best chance to win this hand by letting the dealer potentially bust.

This is a strong hand in blackjack, often referred to as a 'pat hand'. The dealer is showing a Queen, which is a 10-value card. Given that the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17, there's a good chance the dealer's hidden card is a low value, putting them at a disadvantage. Standing on 17 is generally the correct play in this situation, as hitting risks busting (going over 21), while standing gives a good chance of winning if the dealer busts or ends up with a lower total.

The dealer is showing an 8, which means they have a good chance of making a strong hand. In this situation, it's generally better to hit in an attempt to improve my hand. Standing on 15 would likely result in a loss against most dealer hands. By hitting, I have a chance to draw a card that will bring my total closer to 21 without busting, potentially putting me in a better position to win the hand.

This is a relatively weak hand in blackjack, as it's not close enough to 21 to confidently stand, and it's at high risk of busting if I hit and receive a 10-value card. However, in this situation, hitting is generally the best strategic move. The dealer is showing a 9, which means they have a strong chance of reaching 17-21 with their next card. Standing on 15 would likely result in a loss unless the dealer busts. By hitting, I have a chance to improve my hand without risking an immediate loss. There's no option for insurance since the dealer isn't showing a 10 or Ace, and splitting or doubling down wouldn't be appropriate for this hand.

The probability of improving this hand by hitting is extremely low, and the risk of busting (going over 21) is very high. The dealer is showing a 9, which means their best possible hand without hitting would be 19 (if they have a 10-value card hidden). Given that the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17, there's a good chance they will either bust or end up with a lower total than my 20. Standing gives me the best odds of winning this hand.

Splitting a pair of Kings gives you two separate hands, each starting with a powerful 10-value card. This increases your chances of winning on both hands, especially against the dealer's 9. The dealer's 9 is a relatively strong upcard, but it's not as threatening as a 10 or Ace. By splitting, you maximize your potential winnings and put yourself in a favorable position to beat the dealer on both hands. Additionally, splitting Kings is generally considered a standard play in blackjack strategy when the option is available.

This hand beats all other hands except for another blackjack. The dealer's visible card is a 9, which means they cannot have a blackjack. Therefore, standing with this hand guarantees a win unless the dealer also has a blackjack (which is impossible in this case). There's no need to hit, split, or double down as no other action can improve this hand.

This is a weak hand that is likely to lose against the dealer's 9 upcard. The dealer's 9 suggests a strong hand, with a good chance of reaching 18-20. By hitting, I have a chance to improve my hand without risking an immediate bust. Any card from 2 to 9 will improve my position, which represents a majority of the remaining cards in the deck. Even if I receive a 10-value card and bust, I would likely have lost anyway if I had stood on 12. Therefore, hitting is the statistically better choice in this situation.

The dealer has a weak upcard and will need to hit at least once, risking a bust. Standing on 18 is generally considered the correct play in this situation, as hitting would risk busting our already strong hand. Doubling down is not advisable here as it's typically reserved for hands of 9, 10, or 11. Splitting is not an option as we don't have a pair. Therefore, standing gives us the best chance of winning this hand.

The dealer is showing a Queen, which has a value of 10, putting them in a strong position. Given this situation, the best strategy is to hit in an attempt to improve my hand. There's no risk of busting with a 7, and I need to try to get closer to 21 to have a chance of winning against the dealer's strong upcard. Hitting gives me the opportunity to potentially draw a high-value card and significantly improve my hand.

This is a reasonably strong hand in blackjack, especially against a dealer showing a Queen (which has a value of 10). The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17, so there's a good chance the dealer might bust trying to beat my 17. Additionally, if I were to hit, there's a high risk of busting (going over 21) since any card 5 or higher would put me over. Given these factors, the safest and most strategic play is to stand on 17.
