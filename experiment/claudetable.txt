A 10 would give me a strong hand of 20, and any card 7 or higher would improve my position. Standing on 10 would be too weak against the dealer's potential 20. Splitting 3s is not advisable in this situation, and doubling down on 10 is generally only recommended when the dealer shows a weak card (2-9). Therefore, hitting gives the best chance to improve the hand and compete against the dealer's strong upcard. Error

This is a very strong hand in blackjack, as the only way to improve it would be to get an Ace, which would give you 21. However, hitting on 20 is extremely risky, as any card 2 or higher would cause you to bust (go over 21). The dealer is showing a Jack, which has a value of 10. This means the dealer has a strong starting hand, but they would need to draw a face card or 10 to match your 20, and they would bust if they draw anything higher than a 6. Given the strength of your hand and the dealer's visible card, the best strategic choice is to stand and hope the dealer doesn't reach 20 or 21. Error

The dealer is showing a 6, which is a weak upcard. The dealer has a high probability of busting (going over 21) when starting with a 6. Standing on 20 gives you an excellent chance of winning this hand, as the dealer would need to draw to 21 exactly to beat you, which is unlikely. There's no benefit to hitting or doubling down, as you risk busting a strong hand. Splitting is not an option since you don't have a pair. Therefore, standing is the optimal play in this situation.

The dealer is showing a 5, which is a weak upcard. The probability of the dealer busting or ending up with a lower total than 20 is high. Standing on 20 is the optimal play in this situation, as hitting would risk busting and losing a strong hand, while doubling down or splitting are not advisable with this hand composition. The player is in a favorable position and should stand to maximize the chances of winning. Error

The dealer's 6 is a weak upcard, indicating a high probability that they will bust. By splitting, you create two separate hands, each starting with a 3, which gives you more opportunities to build strong hands against the dealer's weak position. This strategy maximizes your potential winnings and takes advantage of the dealer's vulnerable upcard. After splitting, you can hit on both hands to improve them, knowing that the dealer has a good chance of busting when drawing to their 6. Error

The dealer's 6 is a weak upcard, giving them a high chance of busting. However, our hand of 10 is not strong enough to stand on, as we have a good opportunity to improve our hand without risking a bust. By hitting, we have a chance to get a card that will give us a stronger hand (any card 7 or higher would be beneficial), while still maintaining a relatively low risk of busting. This strategy maximizes our chances of beating the dealer's hand. Error

There's a good chance the dealer will bust, as they need to hit on 16 or lower. With 16, you're at risk of busting if you hit. Given that you already have three cards, your options are limited to hit or stand. In this situation, it's generally better to stand and hope the dealer busts, rather than risking a bust yourself by hitting. Error

This is a weak hand that has a high risk of busting if we stand. The dealer's upcard of 6 is considered a weak card, which means the dealer has a good chance of busting. However, our hand is still too weak to stand on. By hitting, we have a good chance of improving our hand without a high risk of busting, given our low total. This gives us the best opportunity to either beat the dealer's hand or at least get closer to 21 without going over. Error

The dealer is showing a 6, which is a weak upcard. Typically, this would suggest standing, as the dealer has a good chance of busting. However, 17 is the lowest 'standing' hand in most strategies, and it's a 'soft' 17 at that. Given that the dealer must hit on their 16 and stand on 17, there's a significant chance they could end up with 18-21. By hitting, I have a chance to improve my hand without risking much, as any card 4 or lower will keep me in the game, while a 5 or higher could potentially give me a stronger hand to beat the dealer. The potential reward outweighs the risk in this scenario. Error

This is a relatively strong hand, especially against a dealer's 9. The dealer has a high chance of busting if they draw a 10-value card (which includes 10, Jack, Queen, and King). Standing on 16 when the dealer shows a 9 is generally considered the optimal play according to basic blackjack strategy. Hitting would risk busting your hand, while the dealer has a good chance of busting or ending up with a lower total. Therefore, standing gives you the best probability of winning in this situation.

The dealer's up card is a weak 2, which increases our chances of winning. Doubling down in this situation allows us to increase our bet when we have an advantage. If we receive a 10-value card (which is likely), we'll have a strong hand of 16 or 26 (counting as 16). Even if we receive a lower card, we'll still have a chance to win against the dealer's weak starting position. This play maximizes our expected value in the long run, despite the risk of potentially losing a larger bet if we receive a low card and the dealer makes a strong hand. Error

A 12 is a weak hand that's likely to lose if you stand. The dealer's 2 is also a weak upcard, but they have a good chance of making a hand between 17 and 21. By hitting, you have a chance to improve your hand without a high risk of busting, as only a 10-value card (about 31% chance) would cause you to go over 21. Statistically, hitting on 12 against a dealer's 2 gives you a better long-term expected value than standing or any other available option. Error

This is a strong hand that has a good chance of winning, especially since the dealer is showing a relatively weak card (2). The dealer will need to hit at least once and has a higher risk of busting. Additionally, since we already have three cards, our options are limited to hit or stand according to the rules. Hitting on 18 would be very risky as there's a high probability of busting (going over 21). Standing gives us the best chance of winning this hand. Error

The dealer's 3 is a middling card, giving them a good chance of making a hand between 17 and 21. Our soft 15 is not strong enough to stand on, as it's likely to lose against the dealer's final hand. Hitting is the best option here because we can improve our hand without risking busting. If we draw a 10-value card, we'll have a strong 15 (or 25, which becomes 15 with the Ace counted as 1). Any card 6 or below will improve our hand while keeping it soft. Even if we draw a 7, 8, or 9, we'll still have a chance to hit again if needed. Doubling down would be too risky with this hand, and we can't split or surrender. Therefore, hitting is the most strategic choice to improve our chances of winning this hand. Error

The Ace is counted as 1 because counting it as 11 would bust the hand. While 15 is not a particularly strong hand, the dealer is showing a weak upcard of 3. There's a good chance the dealer will bust trying to reach 17 or higher. Standing on 15 against a dealer's 3 is generally considered the optimal play in this situation. Hitting risks busting our hand, and we don't have the option to double down or split with three cards. Therefore, standing gives us the best chance to win this hand. Error

A total of 15 is a weak hand that is likely to lose if we stand. By hitting, we have a chance to improve our hand without risking immediate bust (we can receive any card from 2 to 6 without going over 21). The dealer's Jack indicates they have a good chance of having a strong hand, so we need to try to improve our position. Splitting is not an option with 7 and 8, doubling down would be too risky with this weak hand, and surrendering would give up too much equity in this situation. Error

The dealer's upcard of 5 is relatively weak, giving them a higher chance of busting. However, our hand is too weak to stand. The best strategy here is to hit, aiming to improve our hand without risking too much. We don't have the option to split or double down as our cards are not a pair and our total is too low for doubling. Surrendering would be an overreaction to this situation. By hitting, we have a good chance of improving our hand while the dealer has a reasonable chance of busting. Error

The dealer's 5 is a weak upcard, but our hand of 10 is not strong enough to stand. By hitting, we have a good chance of improving our hand without risking a bust, as any card value from 2 to 11 would keep us in the game. Additionally, with three cards already in our hand, our options are limited to hit or stand according to the given rules. In this situation, hitting gives us the best opportunity to build a stronger hand and potentially beat the dealer. Error

The dealer has a weak upcard, but our hand is still vulnerable. There's a good chance of improving our hand without busting, as any card 8 or lower will help. Even if we draw a high card and bust, the dealer still has a significant chance of busting with their weak upcard. Given that we already have four cards, our options are limited to hit or stand, and standing on 13 would be too conservative in this situation. Error

While 18 is generally a good hand, the dealer's 5 is a weak upcard. There's a high probability that the dealer will bust or end up with a lower hand. By hitting, we have the opportunity to improve our hand without much risk of busting. Any card 3 or lower will improve our hand, and even if we draw a face card or 10, we'll still have 18. The potential to get 19-21 outweighs the risk of busting, especially given the dealer's weak position. Error

While 18 is a relatively strong hand, it's not strong enough to confidently stand against a dealer's 7. The dealer has a good chance of making a hand of 17-21, which could beat 18. By hitting, there's a chance to improve the hand without a high risk of busting, as any card 3 or lower would be beneficial. Even if a 4, 5, or 6 is drawn, resulting in a bust, it's still statistically the better play in the long run compared to standing on 18 against a dealer's 7. Error

This decision is based on several factors: 1) A pair of 9s gives a total of 18, which is a strong hand but not unbeatable. 2) By splitting, we create two separate hands, each starting with a 9, which gives us a good chance to make two strong hands. 3) If we hit on 18, we risk busting, and if we stand, we might lose to the dealer's strong upcard. 4) Splitting 9s against a dealer's 10 gives us more flexibility and potentially higher expected value in the long run. Each new hand has a good chance of improving to 19 or better with a single card, which would be stronger against the dealer's likely 20. Even if one hand loses, the other might win, potentially breaking even or coming out ahead. Error

This is because 16 is a weak hand that is likely to lose if you stand, especially against a strong dealer upcard like 10. The dealer has a high probability of having a hand value of 20, which would beat your 16. By hitting, you have a chance to improve your hand without risking much, as you're already in a losing position if you stand. Even if you bust by hitting, you were likely to lose anyway if you stood. The goal is to try to get closer to 21 without going over, and in this situation, the potential benefit of hitting outweighs the risk. Error

The dealer is showing a 10, which means they have a high probability of having a total between 17 and 21. Standing on 17 is generally considered the correct basic strategy play in this situation. While there's a chance the dealer might bust if they have a low card underneath, standing gives you a good opportunity to win if the dealer busts or ends up with a lower total. Hitting risks busting your hand, and doubling down or splitting are not advisable with this hand combination against a strong dealer upcard. Error

A 10 or face card (which are plentiful in the deck) would give you a strong hand of 20, while any card 7 or lower would still leave you in a position to hit again. Standing on 10 would be too weak against the dealer's potential 20, and the hand doesn't qualify for doubling down, splitting, or surrender based on basic strategy. Insurance is not offered since the dealer's up card is not an Ace. Error

The dealer's upcard of Queen suggests a strong hand, likely to result in a total of 20 or 21. Standing on 16 would give the player a high probability of losing. Hitting gives the player a chance to improve their hand without the risk of busting, as any card from Ace to 5 would result in a better hand. While there is a risk of busting with a 6 or higher, the alternative of standing on 16 against a strong dealer upcard is generally considered a worse option in blackjack strategy. Therefore, the best choice in this situation is to hit and hope for a low card to improve the hand. Error
